GPU Computing
=============

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were, as the name suggests, originally designed for the efficient processing of graphics. Over time, they were developed into systems that were capable of performing general purpose computing which is why some people refer to modern GPUs as GP-GPUs (General Purpose Graphical Processing Units).

Graphics processing tpically involves relatively simple computations that need to applied to millions of on-screen pixels in parallel. As such, GPUs tend to be very quick and efficient at computing certain types of parallel workloads.

The `GPUComputing@Sheffield website
<http://gpucomputing.shef.ac.uk/>`_ aims to facilitate the use of GPU computing within University of Sheffield research by providing resources for training and purchasing of equipment as well as providing a network of GPU users and research projects within the University.

.. _GPUCommunity:

GPU Community and NVIDIA Research Centre
----------------------------------------
The University of Sheffield has been officially affiliated with `NVIDIA
<https://research.nvidia.com/>`_ since 2011 as an `NVIDIA CUDA Research Centre
<https://developer.nvidia.com/academia/centers/university-sheffield-cuda-research-center>`_. As such NVIDIA offer us some benefits as a research institution including discounts on hardware, technical liaisons, online training and priority seed hardware for new GPU architectures. For first access to hardware, training and details of upcoming events, discussions and help please join the `GPUComputing google group
<https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/gpucomputing>`_.

.. _GPUAccess:

Requesting access to GPU facilities
-----------------------------------

In order to ensure that the nodes hosting the GPUs run only GPU related tasks, we have defined a special project-group for accessing these nodes. If you wish to take advantage of the GPU processors, please contact research-it@sheffield.ac.uk asking to join the GPU project group.

Any Iceberg/ShARC user can apply to join this group. However, because our GPU resources are limited we will need to discuss the needs of the user and obtain consent from the project leader before allowing usage.

Using GPUs on Iceberg and ShARC
-------------------------------

Hardware, sofware and ways to access GPUs are different on Iceberg and ShARC. Instructions specific to each cluster can be found below:

Version 8.0 of CUDA is :ref:`now available on Iceberg <cuda>`
and the NVIDIA device driver of all nodes containing GPUs has been upgraded to version 367.44.

Some users had reported that the previous NVIDIA device driver had caused problems 
when accessing GPUs from MATLAB; 
initial tests indicate that this is no longer a problem.  
Please let us know if you notice any undesirable changes in behaviour 
on GPU compute nodes or GPU-accelerated visualisation nodes.

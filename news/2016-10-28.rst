The bioinformaticians amongst us may appreciate there is now a :ref:`much newer version of Perl <iceberg_perl>` on Iceberg. 
In addition there are nicer ways of managing Perl packages and BioPerl is installed by default.

.. cut::

**Perl 5.24.0** is purportedly quite a bit faster than our older version of Perl when it comes to numerical operations.  
This version can be activated using the standard 'module load' mechanism.  

Several popular Perl packages have been included with this newer Perl version for convenience,
including: 

* BioPerl (many useful modules for bioinformatics), 
* ``cpanm`` (the de-facto standard Perl package manager)
* ``local::lib`` (for managing your own Perl modules in your home directory.  
  
See :ref:`here <iceberg_perl>` for more info, including
how to use ``local::lib`` to install modules yourself.  

Feedback on this documentation is very welcome.

Community software
==================

Users may wish to install software that is accessible to the wider community.

Community software is installed into ``/usr/local/community``.  A symlink points to this location from ``/usr/local/extras`` to maintain compatibility with Iceberg.

Software installation should follow our installation guide (see :ref:`sharc-software-install-guide`).

Software installations must be maintained by a resposible owner.  Software which is not actively maintained may be removed.

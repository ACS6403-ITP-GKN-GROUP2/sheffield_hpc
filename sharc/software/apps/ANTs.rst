The ANTs framework provids open-source functionality for deformable image registration with small or large deformations. ANTs includes N4 bias correction, additional evaluation of multiple modalities and organ systems, univariate or multivariate image segmentation, tighter integration with the Insight ToolKit, a well evaluated cortical thickness pipeline and visualization tools and integration with R. ANTs serves as both a core library for further algorithm development and also as a command-line application-oriented toolkit. ANTs also has a permissive software license that allows it to be employed freely by industry. ANTs enables diffeomorphic normalization with a variety of transformation models, optimal template construction, multiple types of diffeomorphisms, multivariate similarity metrics, diffusion tensor processing and warping, image segmentation with and with-out priors and measurement of cortical thickness from probabilistic segmentations. The normalization tools, alone, provide a near limitless range of functionality and allow the user to develop customized objective functions.



Usage

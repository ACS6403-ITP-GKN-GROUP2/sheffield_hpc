Getting an Account
==================

Before you can start the clusters you need to register for an account.
An account gives you access to both clusters (ShARC and Iceberg).
Accounts are availible for staff by emailing `helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

The following categories of students can also have an account with
the permission of their supervisors:

* Research Postgraduates
* Taught Postgraduates - project work
* Undergraduates 3rd & 4th year  - project work

Student's supervisors can request an account for the student by emailing
`helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

.. note::

    Once you have obtained your username, you need to initialize your
    password to be the same as your normal password by using the CICS
    `synchronize passwords system <https://www.shef.ac.uk/cics/password>`_.

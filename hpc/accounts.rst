Getting an Account
==================

Before you can start using the clusters you need to register for an HPC account.

An account gives you access to all our clusters (ShARC, Bessemer and Iceberg).

Accounts are availible for staff by emailing `helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

The following categories of students can also have an account with
the permission of their supervisors:

* Research Postgraduates
* Taught Postgraduates - project work
* Undergraduates 3rd & 4th year  - project work

A student's supervisor can request an account for the student by emailing
`helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

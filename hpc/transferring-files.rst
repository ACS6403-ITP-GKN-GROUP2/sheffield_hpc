Transferring files 
==================

To transfer files to/from the clusters you can either:

* Use a program that supports one or both of the SCP and SFTP *protocols* to copy/move files to/from your own machine.
* Use a `Research Storage fileshare <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research-storage/>`_ as common storage directly 
  accessible from your own machine and from the clusters.

A more comprehensive guide to accessing the clusters and transfering files is located at 
`https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/hpc/using/access <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/hpc/using/access>`_.

.. _jh_file_browse: 

Jupyter file browser
====================

**TODO**

NOTES BELOW
-----------

The Home view: Files
--------------------

In addition to running Notebooks, 
Jupyter also allows you to manage files/directories on the Notebook server, 
start terminals and 
edit files, 
all within your web browser.

Ensure that the **Files** tab is selected.  
The bulk of the Notebook server interface should now show the files in your home directory on the clusters:

* The tick-boxes to the left of each item allow you to delete/rename files/directories. 
* Click on a directory to browse into it
* Click on a text file (e.g. a R or Python script) to view/edit it in your browser.  
  You'll notice that Jupyter's text editor understands different programming languages and
  will use colour to make key syntactic elements easier to identify.

The drop-down menu at the top of this list allows you to just select all Notebooks (with ``.ipynb`` file extensions) , all Notebooks that are currently running, all files or all folders.

You can also **upload** single files from your machine to the cluster from this view, either by drag-and-drop or using the *Upload* button.

Using iceberg
=============

Having obtained an iceberg account, you can access iceberg from anywhere to either use it interactively or
to submit long-running batch jobs to its scheduling system ( SGE ). 

SGE scheduler controls the way the cluster resources are shared by all the iceberg users. It gives each user the 
ability to request extra resources such as longer running times, larger memory or access to 
specialist hardware such as the GPU nodes.

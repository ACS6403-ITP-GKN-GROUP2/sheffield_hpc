Iceberg Resource Costs
======================
Normal usage of centrally provided HPC facilities 'i.e. iceberg' at the University of Sheffield is free. For research grants, as with other CICS services, it is included in the central service overhead. This means that users receive a fair share of HPC services alongside other users, who number about 900 in any one academic year.

Researchers requiring compute resources beyond the capabilities of  "free at the point of use" service have the following options:

* :ref:`Use the N8 Regional Computing Facilities <UsetheN8Facilities>`
* :ref:`Purchase HPC hardware <PurchaseHPCHardware>`
* :ref:`Reserve a portion of the local HPC facilities for a length of time <ReserveHPC>`

Use the N8 Facilities
---------------------

.. _UsetheN8Facilities:

The University of Sheffield has a 1/8 share of the N8 HPC facility and manages access to it on behalf of researchers at The University of Sheffield. Details on how to access the facility are at http://n8hpc.org.uk/getting-started

We also provide some local N8 related information on our web pages. FIXME

Purchase HPC Hardware
---------------------

.. _PurchaseHPCHardware:

Research groups can work with CICS to purchase hardware that will sit within the framework of iceberg while delivering dedicated HPC services for their research. This will give research teams the advantage of having access to dedicated resources while continuing to take advantage of the 'free' facilities as well. The University of Sheffield has a framework agreement for procuring such extra HPC hardware at favourable prices. This is prepared by CICS working with the Research Computing Advisory Group. Research groups who are interested should initially contact hpchub@sheffield.ac.uk to start a dialog.  
It is important to note that the 'framework agreement' ensures and in a way limits the choice of new hardware so as to be able to integrate it with the iceberg cluster.

Reserve HPC Compute Resources
-----------------------------

.. _ReserveHPC:

Researchers can reserve a fraction of the central HPC facility for a length of time which they specify. This is paid for using a project research grant or other funds. See current HPC purchasing costs and procedures for more details.

Extra File Storage Costs
------------------------

CiCS also provides general purpose networked file storage at prices ranging from £260 per TB per annum to £900 per TB per annum depending on backup requirements (e.g if there is a requirement to backup to tape, or mirror data to a separate location) - for more information on this please see the CICS information on filestore.
